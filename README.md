1. In this [video](https://youtu.be/9ME94z46fsU?si=CQOBlSaPJBa5AzfF)  we will configure H2 in memory (embedded) Database Engine for our Java Spring Boot application. We will start with setting up all of the necessary properties in application.properties file. Then we will create our frist Entity using JPA and persist it in the H2 database. We will also learn how to enable web console for H2, define JDBC URL connection, set user, password, path and mode of the H2 DB. We will learn how to run H2 in two modes - file and in memory. In case of file mode data will not disappear after each application restart. I hope you enjoy this tutorial and presented examples, keep playing with code!
